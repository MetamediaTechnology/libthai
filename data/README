This directory contains Thai word lists.

Files listed in 'Makefile.am' will be used to construct a dictionary for
the Thai word-breaking function (thbrk).

Misspelled words
================

It is important to note that 'tdict-spell.txt' is a list of misspelled words.
From the thbk perspective, it is needed so that sentences with misspelled words
can be segmented optimally.

Due to this characteristic, this particular word list is not suitable for
spelling-check purposes. To construct a dictionary of correctly spelled words,
please omit this file.
