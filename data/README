It's crucial to understand the distinct purposes of 'tdict-spell.txt' and
'tdict-common.txt'.

- tdict-spell.txt: This file exclusively lists misspelled words.
  It is used by the word-breaking function (thbk) to optimize sentence
  boundaries, even in the presence of spelling errors.

- tdict-common.txt: This file contains commonly used words, including those
  with alternative spellings or foreign origins. While these words might not
  be officially recognized by language authorities, they are widely accepted
  in everyday usage.

To construct a dictionary of correctly spelled words, it is recommended to omit
'tdict-spell.txt'.
